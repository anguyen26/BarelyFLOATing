# 16b ARM Microprocessor
###### _With Floating Point Unit_
&nbsp;
## Project Description
This project impliments a 16-bit CPU that runs a reduced list of the ARM instruction set which is detailed below.
It also impliments a 16-bit Floating Point Unit (FPU) utilizing the Bfloat16 single presicion format.
Additionally there is a makefile flow for performing SAPR with Synopsis DC and ICC in the TSMC N65 technology.
Finally there is a verifiction flow for testing each type of test (below) at each stage of design (RTL, SYN, SAPR) and verify against the expected results.
- Full list of instructions implimented in core [here](https://github.com/anguyen26/BarelyFLOATing/blob/main/Resources/CustomThumbInstructions.pdf)
